            <h1>Swimming</h1>
            <p>Swimming is a powerful and versatile activity that goes beyond being a sport or a simple fitness routine.
              It can be a source of joy, relaxation, and accomplishment for those who take it up as a hobby. 
              Whether you’re an experienced swimmer gliding through the water with ease or a novice just learning to stay afloat.</p>

            <h1>Coding</h1>
            <p>
              Coding excites me because it's a mix of creativity and problem-solving. 
              When I'm coding, I feel like I'm piecing together a digital puzzle, 
              crafting something new out of lines of code. It can be challenging, but that's part of the fun. 
              Whether I'm building a simple app or working on a complex project, there's a sense of accomplishment 
              when everything starts to click. Debugging can be frustrating,
              but the moment I fix a tricky bug, it's like hitting the jackpot</p>

            <h1>Playing Guitar</h1>
            <p>Playing guitar is my happy place, my way to connect with my emotions and everything around me.
               I love how the strings feel under my fingers and how the chords resonate, filling the room with sound.
               When I strum, it's not just about playing notes; it's like I'm having a conversation with the music,
               sharing my thoughts, my highs, and my lows. Each song tells a story, and I get to choose what it says.
               Whether it's a soft acoustic tune or a screaming electric solo, the guitar gives me the freedom to explore,
               create, and just let go. It's my escape, my therapy, and my way to be truly me.</p>

            <h1>Playing Basketball</h1>
            <p>Basketball is more than just a game to me; it's a blend of skill, strategy, and sheer passion that electrifies my spirit.
               Every dribble, pass, and shot is a chance to express creativity and teamwork. The court is a canvas where
               I can explore my limits, pushing myself to be faster, stronger, and more in tune with my teammates.
               The thrill of competition fuels my drive, while the camaraderie keeps me grounded. I love how basketball brings
               people together, uniting us with a common goal and a shared love for the game. It's an outlet for energy, a source of joy,
               and a reminder that greatness is achieved through hard work and collaboration. When I'm on the court, I feel alive.</p>

        <h2>Student/Webdesign begginer</h2>
        <p>I'm Clint John S. Candalisa a.k.a "Cjay", a 21-year-old student at JRMSU Katipunan Campus,
          where I'm working toward my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I live in San Isidro
          Sergio Osmena Zamboanga Del Norte, and I'm the second child in my family.
          My goal is to succeed so I can support the people who have always been there for me.
          They're the reason I work so hard, and I want to give back to them for everything they've done for me.
